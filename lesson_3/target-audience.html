            <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
            <p>
                I read through 2 articles which included actual survey's to deteremine
                who checks the weather reports and where is their go to source.
                There was a factor on one study that showed more women than men check 
                weather reports daily. The largest demographic being the 45-59 age group.
                Of this age group, approximately 56% were women.
                <a href="https://medium.com/information-expositions-f2019/who-checks-the-weather-dc7d37971e34">
                <br>
                The 2nd report determined that the 20-35 age group and 60+ age group was 
                the largest 2 groups that consistenly checked weather reports. 
                While the groups in both studies represented different age demographics, 
                the findings of where they got their news reports remained the same. 
                <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weather-forecast-news-app-habits/">
                <br>
                Both studies determined that the most popular place to check the weather report 
                was a default weather app. The second sourse, is the local TV news. This came as a surpise to the 
                writers running the study. The third is a specific website or app and the fourth
                is The Weather Channel. I based my personas and scenarios off of these studies.
