            <p>The first adventure is perfect for beginners. We encourage those

               know the route and commands that will be asked of them to do as we paddle
               down the river. The parts of the Salmon River we will explore will be mostly
               Level I & II. The tour also consists of a lunch break and is 4 hours long. 
               We stop off will be at Lakeside Bunglows for the break for 1 hour. 
               Then continue onto Riggins. The total time rafting will be approximately 2 hours.
