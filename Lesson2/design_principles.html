        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p> The makings of a clean website should incorporate blank space
            between content. The breaks give the users mind and eye a break
            from all the visual stimulating imagery and between words. It gives balance
            to the page, and can help highlight on the items of importance. 
            <br>


        <h3>Clark Realty Website</h3>
            <li><a href="https://www.clarkhawaii.com">Clark Realty Real Estate Page</a></li>
            One website that I have seen incorporate the use of white space is a local
            real estate company in my area. The top of the website focuses on the information which 
            requires user input in order to utilize the website in searching for properties for sale. 
            The utilization of a white background helps to focus the eye on filling out the form. 
            A single colored button with the words "Search" stands out as the focus of the page.

            <br>
            White space is also incorporated in between photo blocks featuring different types
            of properties. The photos themselves already have vivid colors and therefore 
            stand out on their own. There is also very little colors that 
            are incoporated in the overall design. This helps to focus on what is being sold 
            in the website which is the homes and the location in which the homes belong.
