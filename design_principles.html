        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p> A clean website should incorporate blank spaces know as "white space"
            between content. The breaks give a users mind and eye a break
            between visual stimulating imagery and letters. White space provides 
            balance and can help highlight items of importance for the user. When white
            space is utilitzed in designs, the simplicity of the site offers more 
            opporunities to showcase more photography or graphics. 
            <br>

        <h3><li><a href="https://www.clarkhawaii.com">Clark Realty Website</a></li></h3>
            One website that I have seen incorporate the use of white space is a local
            real estate company in my area. The top of the website focuses on the information which 
            requires user input in order to utilize the website in searching for properties for sale. 
            The utilization of a white background helps to focus the eye on filling out the form. 
            Two similar colored buttons with the words "Search" stands out as the focus of the page.

            <br>
            White space is also incorporated in between photo blocks featuring different types
            of properties. The photos themselves already have vivid colors and therefore 
            stand out on their own. There is also very little colors that 
            are incoporated in the overall design. The photos of homes and the landscapes
            offer the visual appeal to the user.  This helps to focus on what is being sold 
            in the website.
