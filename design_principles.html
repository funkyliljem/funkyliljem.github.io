            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <br>
            <p> A clean website should incorporate blank spaces know as "white space"
                between content. The breaks give a users mind and eye a break
                between visual stimulating imagery and letters. White space provides
                balance and can help highlight items of importance for the user. When white
                space is utilitzed in designs, the simplicity of the site offers more
                opporunities to showcase more photography or graphics.
                <br>

                <h3><a href="https://www.clarkhawaii.com">Clark Realty Website</a></h3>
                One website that I have seen incorporate the use of white space is a local
                real estate company in my area. The top of the website focuses on the information which
                requires user input in order to utilize the website in searching for properties for sale.
                The utilization of a white background helps to focus the eye on filling out the form.
                Two similar colored buttons with the words "Search" stands out as the focus of the page.

                <br>
                <br>
                White space is also incorporated in between photo blocks featuring different types
                of properties. The photos themselves already have vivid colors and therefore
                stand out on their own. There is also very little colors that
                are incoporated in the overall design. The photos of homes and the landscapes
                offer the visual appeal to the user. This helps to focus on what is being sold
                in the website.

            <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Repetition in website creation helps to promote a theme and provides
                co-hesiveness to the design. Repeating colors, fonts, or similar groupings
                of photos can promote branding in a variety of ways.

                <h3><a href="https://www.adidas.com">Adidas Website</a></h3>
                The sports brand Adidas incorporates creative ways in promoting their
                logo and brand throughout the website. The colors of black and white are
                repeated in the logo, font, and background. Down to the colors that the models wear
                and merchadise displayed in blocks are repeated. All the items featured for sale are in the black or
                white color.
