            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <br>
            <p> A clean website should incorporate blank spaces know as "white space"
                between content. The breaks give a users mind and eye a break
                between visual stimulating imagery and letters. White space provides
                balance and can help highlight items of importance for the user. When white
                space is utilitzed in designs, the simplicity of the site offers more
                opporunities to showcase more photography or graphics.
                <br>

                <h3><a href="https://www.clarkhawaii.com">Clark Realty Website</a></h3>
                One website that I have seen incorporate the use of white space is a local
                real estate company in my area. The top of the website focuses on the information which
                requires user input in order to utilize the website in searching for properties for sale.
                The utilization of a white background helps to focus the eye on filling out the form.
                Two similar colored buttons with the words "Search" stands out as the focus of the page.

                <br>
                <br>
                White space is also incorporated in between photo blocks featuring different types
                of properties. The photos themselves already have vivid colors and therefore
                stand out on their own. There is also very little colors that
                are incoporated in the overall design. The photos of homes and the landscapes
                offer the visual appeal to the user. This helps to focus on what is being sold
                in the website.

            <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Repetition in website creation helps to promote a theme and provides
                co-hesiveness to the design. Repeating colors, fonts, or similar groupings
                of photos can promote branding in a variety of ways.

                <h3><a href="https://www.adidas.com">Adidas Website</a></h3>
                The sports brand Adidas incorporates creative ways in promoting their
                logo and brand throughout the website. The colors of black and white are
                repeated in the logo, font, and background. The blocks containing merchadise 
                a subtle greyish-white so showcase their black & white motif.

                <br>
                <br>
                The consistency in repeating their logo colors also extends to the clothing modeled and 
                merchadise displayed in blocks are repeated at the bottom of the website. All the items 
                featured for sale are in the black or white color although they come in other colors as well. 
                There are a few pops of color to break up parts of the site but for the most part, 
                everything featured is repeated with the black and white theme.

            <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Contrast is being able to utilize colors for the background and foreground in a way
                differentiates the two. Typically, the areas of importance should be easily seen by
                using either color, various font sizes or how or where images are placed in the design.
                Contrast gives the viewer the focal point of a design and to call their attention
                to a section or in the case of a website a call to action on a particular part of the site.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3><a href="https://www.bathandbodyworks.com">Bath & Body Works Website</a></h3>
                The Bath & Body Works website exemplifies contrast. There are 2 bold colors in direct
                contrast with each other. The page immediately draws the eye to stop and really take a 
                look at what the page is offering which are the sales items. The contrast colors of the pink and yellow background
                coupled with the black and white contrast of the font helps to balance the contrast of 
                the page. Also there are contrasts in the shapes of the rectangle versus the circle in the 
                upper left side corner. Contrast also continues in the visual heirarchy of font sizes.

                <br>
                <br>
                At the bottom of the website, the contrast continues but in a different variation. Rather 
                than bright contrasting background colors, the background color is a solid white. The 
                featured instgram posts feature the brigh colors of products and continue the contrast 
                through the photography rather than the background colors.
